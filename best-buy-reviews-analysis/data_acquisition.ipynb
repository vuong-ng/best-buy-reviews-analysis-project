    "# Product Research Project using Reviews Best Buy\n",
    "\n",
    "**Context:** Vacuum cleaner is an essential home appliance of  a majority of the US households. As a result, customers are offered various options that come with different price tags. This project aims to analyze the pros and cons between a high-end vacuum and a cheap one in order to find out why and why not the customers would buy the products and whether it is worth it to pay more. This study will play as a research process in the Research and Development cycle which enables the optimization of both products and reduces post-launch problems. \n",
    " \n",
    "**Central questions:**\n",
    "Which aspects of a luxurious vacuum cleaner outperform those of the cheaper one?\n",
    "Which features of both chosen products receive the highest number of  positive/negative/neutral feedbacks?\n"
