## Project goals:
- The goal of this project to generate profound insights as to how customers feel about the service that Amazon provides for each type of product. Instead of only using products ratings, in the project, we will implement sentiment analysis to find out how positive/negative the reviews are. We will utilize nltk (Natural Language Toolkit) to calculate the negative, positive, and compound score of the reviews. Then, we will visualize the result using the compound score along with the ratings (from 1 to 5) to see the correlation between ratings and the positivity/negativity of the reviews. In that way, we can objectively assess the customersâ€™ experience with the product.
- For visualization: we will use word cloud to look for the most common adjectives and the most common nouns in each product category to find out what people like about the product provided.

## Questions proposed:
- Which type of product receives the most positive review using sentiment scores?
- What about the products/services they like the most? (Finding the most common adjectives and nouns to see how people actually feel about the products)

## Packages/modules that will be used:
- NLTK (Natural Language Tool Kit)
- Textlib wordcloud
